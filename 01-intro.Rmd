R Vs Python: Whatâ€™s the Difference? https://www.guru99.com/r-vs-python.html

## About R and Python

### R 

R is an object oriented, open source programming **language** and **environment** for statistical computing and graphics. R is not a statistics system but an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. Further, R gains more capabilities via packages, its fundamental shareable units that bundle together R functions, code, data, documentation, and tests etc. [@Rcoreteam2020]. 

### Python 

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. The motto of Python language is "Batteries included" as the functionality of the language can be performed via its comprehensive standard in built Libraries [@wikipython].

## History of R and Python

### R 

R is an implementation of the S programming language which was created by John Chambers in 1976. In 1991, an alternative implementation of the basic S language was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, University of Auckland, New Zealand.  It was published in 1993 [@wikiR].

### Python 

In 1989, Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands started the implementation of Python  as a successor to ABC programming language. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible  was released in 2008 [@wikipython] . Today many  developers create libraries strictly for the use with Python 3.


## Story behind their names

### R 

R was introduced by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman and it was named after the first names of the two authors. The name of the "S" language also had some influence on the selection of its name and it was selected partly as a play on the name of S [@wikiR]. 


### Python

Python was named after a famous [TV show 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus). Guido van Rossum, the creater of Python was a big fan of the TV show. He wanted to name his invention with a short, unique and slightly mysterious name and chose Python as a working title for his ongoing project.

datatsibble <- data%>% pivot_longer(cols=2:3,names_to = "Language", values_to = "Google trends (worldwide)" )

datatsibble$Month <- yearmonth(datatsibble$Month)
datatsibble <- datatsibble %>% as_tsibble(index = Month, key = Language)
p<- datatsibble %>% autoplot() +
  xlab("Time")
print(p)
```

## Installation

### R 

You can download it for free from the following websites:
- R (https://cran.r-project.org/) 

**Install Rstudio IDE**

RStudio is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.

- RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).


### Python 

Ref: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

```C:\Users\Your Name>python --version```

To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:

```python --version```

If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/

**Install PyCharm IDE**

PyCharm is a cross-platform IDE that provides consistent experience on the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

PyCharm is available in three editions: Professional, Community, and Edu. The Community and Edu editions are open-source projects and they are free, but they have fewer features. PyCharm Edu provides courses and helps you learn programming with Python. The Professional edition is commercial, and provides an outstanding set of tools and features. For details, see the editions comparison matrix.

## Install and Load Libraries

An **R package** is a way to organize your own work and share it with others. Typically, a package contains code, documentation for the package and the functions inside, some tests to check everything works as it should, and data sets.

Three of the most popular repositories for R packages are: CRAN, Bioconductor and Github.

#### Installing Packages From CRAN

`install.packages("package_name")`

Example

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

After running this, some messages will be diplayed on the console. They will depend on what operating system you are using, the dependencies, and if the package was successfully installed.

To install more than a package at the same time, we can use a character vector 

`install.packages(c("vioplot", "MASS"))`

**The function `install.packages` will download the source code from on the CRAN mirrors and install the package (and any dependencies) locally on your computer.**

You have to install a package only once.

#### Load Packages

After a package is installed, you are ready to use its functionalities. 

If you just need a sporadic use of a few functions or data inside a package you can access them with the notation 

`packagename::functionname()`.

If you will make a more intensive use of the package, then maybe is worth to load it into memory. The simplest way to do this is with the `library()` command.

Please note that the input of install.packages() is a character vector and requires the name to be in quotes, while library() accepts either character or name and makes it possible for you to write the name of the package without quotes.

Once you have the package installed, you can load the library into your R session for use. Any of the functions that are specific to that package will be available for you to use by simply calling the function as you would for any of the base functions. Note that quotations are not required here.

`library(tidyverse)`

### Python

Use 'import module' or 'from module import'? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710551/use-import-module-or-from-module-import


**Method 1:** `import module`

**Method 2:** `from module import foo`

The difference between `import module` and `from module import foo` is  subjective. User can select one method and be consitent in the use of it. 

`import module`  |  `from module import foo`
-----------------|-----------------------
**Pros**             |   **Pros**
- Less Maintanence of the import statements  | - Less typying to use `foo` function
- Don't need to add any aditional imports to start using another item from the same module  |  - More control over whcih items of the module can be accessed
**Cons**             |   **Cons**
-  Typing `module.foo` in the code be tedious (dull, boring )  | to use new items from the module the user have to update the `import` statement

- It can be minimized by using `import module as mo`, then typing `mo.foo`  | You loose context about `foo`. For example it is less clear `ceil()` does, compared to `math.ceil()`


**Don't use**

- `from modle import *`

   - Because it clutters or fills with untidy collection of things in the namespace
   
- `import *`

   - For any reasonable large set of code, if you `import *` you will likely be cementing it into the module, unable to be removed.
   
   - This is because now it is difficullt to identiify what items used in the code are coming from `module`.
