R is not a statistics system but an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. Further, R gains more capabilities via packages, its fundamental shareable units that bundle together R functions, code, data, documentation, and tests etc. (R Core Team 2020). 1.1.2 Python Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. The motto of Python language is “Batteries included” as the functionality of the language can be performed via its comprehensive standard in built Libraries (Wikipedia contributors 2020a). 1.2 History of R and Python 1.2.1 R R is an implementation of the S programming language which was created by John Chambers in 1976. In 1991, an alternative implementation of the basic S language was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, University of Auckland, New Zealand. It was published in 1993 (Wikipedia contributors 2020b). 1.2.2 Python In 1989, Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands started the implementation of Python as a successor to ABC programming language. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible was released in 2008 (Wikipedia contributors 2020a) . Today many developers create libraries strictly for the use with Python 3. 1.3 Story behind their names 1.3.1 R R was introduced by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and it was named after the first names of the two authors. The name of the “S” language also had some influence on the selection of its name and it was selected partly as a play on the name of S (Wikipedia contributors 2020b). 1.3.2 Python Python was named after a famous TV show ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’. Guido van Rossum, the creater of Python was a big fan of the TV show. He wanted to name his invention with a short, unique and slightly mysterious name and chose Python as a working title for his ongoing project. 1.4 Logo Figure 1.1: Retrieved from: https://www.r-project.org/logo/ Figure 1.2: Retrieved from: https://www.python.org/community/logos/ 1.5 Worldwide Google Trends 1.6 Installation 1.6.1 Python Ref: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed. To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe): C:\\Users\\Your Name&gt;python --version To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type: python --version If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/ 1.6.2 R You can download it for free from the following websites: R (https://cran.r-project.org/) RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 1.7 Ranked:15Python packages for Data Science http://blog.thedataincubator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ranked-15-Python-Packages-for-Data-Science.pdf References "],["variables-expressions-and-statements.html", "Chapter 2 Variables, expressions, and statements 2.1 Basic Exmaple", " Chapter 2 Variables, expressions, and statements 2.1 Basic Exmaple This is a test code 2.1.1 R code # This is an R code x &lt;- 1 y &lt;- 3 print(x+y) ## [1] 4 2.1.2 Python Code The ‘python’ engine in knitr requires the reticulate package. library(reticulate) # This is a Python code x = 1 y = 3 print(x+y) ## 4 "],["conditional-execution.html", "Chapter 3 Conditional execution", " Chapter 3 Conditional execution WIP "],["functions.html", "Chapter 4 Functions", " Chapter 4 Functions WIP "],["iteration.html", "Chapter 5 Iteration", " Chapter 5 Iteration WIP "],["import.html", "Chapter 6 Import", " Chapter 6 Import WIP "],["tidy.html", "Chapter 7 Tidy", " Chapter 7 Tidy WIP "],["transform.html", "Chapter 8 Transform", " Chapter 8 Transform WIP "],["visualize.html", "Chapter 9 Visualize", " Chapter 9 Visualize WIP "],["model.html", "Chapter 10 Model", " Chapter 10 Model WIP "],["communicate.html", "Chapter 11 Communicate", " Chapter 11 Communicate WIP "],["advanced-r-and-python.html", "Chapter 12 Advanced R and Python 12.1 Time Series Forecasting", " Chapter 12 Advanced R and Python WIP 12.1 Time Series Forecasting R Python fable-Forecasting Models for Tidy Time Series statsmodels- Statistics based models forecast- Forecasting Functions for Time Series and Linear Models sktime- A unified framework for machine learning with time series \\(\\text{}\\) GluonTS- Deep learning-based models.
